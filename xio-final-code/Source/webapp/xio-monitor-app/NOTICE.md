### BSD 3-Clause License (Revised)
<p>The BSD 3-Clause License The following is a BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") license template. To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own.</p><p>Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its colloquial name "BSD New", this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the "Simplified BSD License". On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final "no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.</p><p>Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of any product using that code. It was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that clause 3 is "hereby deleted in its entirety." The four clause license has not been approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the advertising clause.</p><p>This prelude is not part of the license.</p><p>OWNER = Regents of the University of California </p><p>ORGANIZATION = University of California, Berkeley </p><p>YEAR = 1998</p><p>In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase "COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read "REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS".</p><h2>License template</h2><p>Copyright (c) $YEAR $OWNER, All rights reserved.</p><p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without 
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are

For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified."; to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. For the avoidance of doubt:</p><p>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p><p>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p><p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p><p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>7. Termination</p><p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous</p><p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</p>

The Licensor’s liability is limited to the commitments made under this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result , in particular: (i) of loss due the Licensee’s total or partial failure to fulfill its obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software’s use or performance that is suffered by the Licensee, when the latter is a professional using said Software for professional purposes and (iii) consequential loss due to the Software’s use or performance. The Parties expressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data, loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders, opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party, shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to any or all compensation from the Licensor.</p><h3>Article 9 - WARRANTY</h3><p>9.1. The Licensee acknowledges that the current situation as regards scientific and technical know-how at the time when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee’s attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software that are reserved for experienced users.</p><p>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the product’s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper functioning, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or property.</p><p>9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights on the Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article 5).</p><p>9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied “as is” by the Licensor without any or all other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any or all warranty as to its market value, its securised, innovative or relevant nature.</p><p>Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee’s own equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee’s requirements.</p><p>9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee’s use of the Software’s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.</p><h3>Article 10 - TERMINATION</h3><p>10.1. In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective.</p><p>10.2. The Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any or all licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.</p><h3>Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h3><h4>11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS</h4><p>Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning, or interruptions affecting the electricity or telecommunications networks, blocking of the network following a virus attack, the intervention of the government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.</p><p>11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.</p><p>11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.</p><p>11.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.</p><h4>11.5. LANGUAGE</h4><p>The Agreement is drafted in both French and English. In the event of a conflict as regards construction, the French version shall be deemed authentic.</p><h3>Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT</h3><p>12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement.</p><p>12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, that reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may incorporate new problems encountered by the free software.</p><p>12.3. Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of article 5.3.4.</p><h3>Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3><p>13.1. The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement out-of-court.</p><p>13.2. In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months as from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.</p><p><a href="http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL_V1-US.html#sdfootnote1anc">1</a> Ce: CEA, C: CNRS, I: INRIA, LL: Logiciel Libre</p><p>Version 1 of 06/21/2004</p>

### ANTLR Software Rights Notice (ANTLR-PD)
<p>NTLR 2 License</p><p>We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.</p><p>We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.</p>

### GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0)
<p>GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPL-2.0)</p><p>The GNU General Public License (GPL-2.0)</p><p>Version 2, June 1991</p><p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</p><p>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</p><p>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p><p>Preamble</p><p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p><p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p><p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p><p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p><p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p><p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p><p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p><p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p><p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p><p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p><p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p><p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p><p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p><p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p><p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p><p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p><p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p><p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p><p>NO WARRANTY</p><p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p><p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p><p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p><p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p><p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</p><p>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p><p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p><p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</p><p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p><p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p><p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p><p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p><p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p><p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p><p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p><p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989</p><p>Ty Coon, President of Vice</p><p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</p>

You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</p><p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p><p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p><p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p><p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p><p>3.4.

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p><p>5. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p><p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p><p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p><p>6. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</p><p>7. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p><p>8. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p><p>9. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p><p>10. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p><p>10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</p><p>10.3. Modified Versions If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).</p><p>10.4.

The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.

Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor.

The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.

If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).</p><p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p><p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p><p>12) Attorneys' Fees.

### Common Public License 1.0 (CPL-1.0)
<p>Common Public License Version 1.0</p><p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC <br>LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM <br>CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p>1. DEFINITIONS</p><p>"Contribution" means:</p><p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and <br>documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p><p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p><p>i) changes to the Program, and</p><p>ii) additions to the Program;</p><p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are <br>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a <br>Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone <br>acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to <br>the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in <br>conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not <br>derivative works of the Program.</p><p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p><p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are <br>necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when <br>combined with the Program.</p><p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p><p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, <br>including all Contributors.</p><p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p><p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to <br>reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, <br>distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such <br>derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p><p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed <br>Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the <br>Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. <br>This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the <br>Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such <br>addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the <br>Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations <br>which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p><p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses <br>to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any <br>Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual <br>property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to <br>Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of <br>intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the <br>rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole <br>responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. <br>For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to <br>distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license <br>before distributing the Program.</p><p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient <br>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set <br>forth in this Agreement.</p><p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p><p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its <br>own license agreement, provided that:</p><p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p><p>b) its license agreement:</p><p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and <br>conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and <br>non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and <br>fitness for a particular purpose;</p><p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for <br>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential <br>damages, such as lost profits;</p><p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered <br>by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p><p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such <br>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or <br>through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p><p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p><p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p><p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p><p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the <br>Program.</p><p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if <br>any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the <br>originator of the Contribution.</p><p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p><p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with <br>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is <br>intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who <br>includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner <br>which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if <br>a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such <br>Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify <br>every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages <br>and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal <br>actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the <br>extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in <br>connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product <br>offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses <br>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order <br>to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial <br>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to <br>control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any <br>related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in <br>any such claim at its own expense.</p><p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product <br>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that <br>Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties <br>related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such <br>Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the <br>Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other <br>Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court <br>requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial <br>Contributor must pay those damages.</p><p>5. NO WARRANTY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN <br>"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR <br>IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, <br>NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each <br>Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and <br>distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of <br>rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of <br>program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, <br>programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p><p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p><p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY <br>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, <br>SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST <br>PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, <br>STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY <br>OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS <br>GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>7. GENERAL</p><p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable <br>law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the <br>terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such <br>provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such <br>provision valid and enforceable.</p><p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to <br>a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a <br>lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient <br>under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In <br>addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity <br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program <br>itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) <br>infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under <br>Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p><p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to <br>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does <br>not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of <br>such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, <br>Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as <br>reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement <br>and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and <br>survive.</p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in <br>order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be <br>modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to <br>publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. <br>No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. <br>IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve <br>as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the <br>Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including <br>Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement <br>under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement <br>is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its <br>Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections <br>2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the <br>intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether <br>expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not <br>expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p><p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the <br>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this <br>Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year <br>after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in <br>any resulting litigation.</p>

Distribution Obligations.</p><p>3.1. Application of License.</p><p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are <br>governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation <br>Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be <br>distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version <br>of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a <br>copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You <br>distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code <br>version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this <br>License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include <br>an additional document offering the additional rights described in <br>Section 3.5.</p><p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p><p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be <br>made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License <br>either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an <br>Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic <br>Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) <br>months after the date it initially became available, or at least six <br>(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification <br>has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for <br>ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p><p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p><p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a <br>file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and <br>the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that <br>the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original <br>Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the <br>Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an <br>Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the <br>origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p><p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</p><p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p><p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's <br>intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights <br>granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor <br>must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled <br>"../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in <br>sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If <br>Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made <br>available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly <br>modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available <br>thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate <br>mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who <br>received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p><p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p><p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming <br>interface ("API"../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses <br>which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must <br>also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p><p>(c) Representations.</p><p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section <br>3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications <br>are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has <br>sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this <br>License</p><p>.</p><p>3.5. Required Notices.</p><p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source <br>Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source <br>Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a <br>location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely <br>to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) <br>You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <br>Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation <br>for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership <br>rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to <br>charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability <br>obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You <br>may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial <br>Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than <br>any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is <br>offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial <br>Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the <br>Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, <br>support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p><p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the <br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, <br>and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of <br>the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, <br>including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the <br>obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included <br>in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or <br>collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the <br>Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered <br>Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may <br>contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in <br>compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the <br>Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's <br>rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this <br>License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different <br>license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ <br>from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial <br>Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the <br>Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by <br>the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such <br>terms You offer.</p><p>3.7. Larger Works.</p><p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other <br>code <br>not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger <br>Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the <br>requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this <br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to <br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with <br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) <br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description <br>must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must <br>be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the <br>extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be <br>sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to <br>understand it.</p><p>5. Application of this License.</p><p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has <br>attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p><p>6. Versions of the License.</p><p>6.1. New Versions.</p><p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions <br>of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a <br>distinguishing version number.</p><p>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p><p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of <br>the <br>License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that <br>version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms <br>of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one <br>other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered <br>Code created under this License.</p><p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p><p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you <br>may <br>only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code <br>governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that <br>the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL"../ or any confusingly <br>similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your <br>license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear <br>that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the <br>Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, <br>Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A <br>shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this <br>License.)</p><p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p><p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "../AS IS'' BASIS, <br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF <br>DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. <br>THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE <br>IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, <br>YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE <br>COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER <br>OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF <br>ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS <br>DISCLAIMER.</p><p>8. TERMINATION.</p><p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate <br>automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure <br>such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All <br>sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall <br>survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their <br>nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License <br>shall survive.</p><p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement <br>claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer <br>or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom <br>You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging <br>that:</p><p>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly <br>infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such <br>Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License <br>shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, <br>unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) <br>agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable <br>royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such <br>Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to <br>the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days <br>of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not <br>mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim <br>is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under <br>Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of <br>the 60 day notice period specified above.</p><p>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's <br>Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then <br>any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) <br>and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, <br>sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that <br>Participant.</p><p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant <br>alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or <br>indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as <br>by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent <br>infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses <br>granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken <br>into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or <br>license.</p><p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, <br>all <br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) <br>which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder <br>prior to termination shall survive termination.</p><p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT <br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL <br>DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, <br>OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR <br>ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY <br>CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, <br>WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER <br>COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN <br>INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF <br>LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY <br>RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW <br>PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE <br>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO <br>THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p><p>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in <br>48 <br>C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" <br>and "commercial computer software documentation,"../ as such terms are <br>used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. <br>12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all <br>U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights <br>set forth herein.</p><p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p><p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject <br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be <br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent <br>necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by <br>California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if <br>any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. <br>With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, <br>or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United <br>States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be <br>subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern <br>District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, <br>California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including <br>without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and <br>expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on <br>Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. <br>Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract <br>shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this <br>License.</p><p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p><p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is <br>responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, <br>out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to <br>work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such <br>responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or <br>shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p><p>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</p><p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as <br>?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial <br>Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under <br>Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the <br>Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.</p><p>Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.</p><p>The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License</p><p>Version 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in</p><p>compliance with the License.
