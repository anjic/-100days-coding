Introduction of YAML:
--------------------
YAML file start with (---) and end with(...)
ex: 


Ansible 2.7:
--------------
Ansible modules for system Administration tasks,
-- Inventories
-- Module
-- Variable
-- Facts
-- Plays
-- Playbooks
-- Configuaration Files

Inventories:
-------------
- Inventories as list of hosts
- Inventories are how ansible can locate and run against multiple systems.
- By default Ansile uses /etc/ansible/hosts as its inventory but it is configuarable.
- Inventory support both in INI and yaml file formats.

Ex:
save the Inventory file as hosts.ini under /etc/ansible/hosts

testhost1.linuxacademy.com

[httpd]
testhost2.linuxacademy.com
testhost3.linuxacademy.com

[labservers]
testhost[1:6].linuxacademy.com

#Ansible command to run.
$ ansible <hostname/ip/group name in the inventory> -m ping
# Here -m means module name

$ ansible all -m ping 
# Here all means, To run ansible command all hosts

$ ansible -i hosts.ini httpd -m ping
# -i means inventory file name and group name


Modules:
----------------
- Module are essentially tools for particualr tasks
- Module can take parameters
- they return JSON
- Can run from the command line or within a playbook
- There are a significant number of modules for many kinds of work(AWS,azure,security..etc)
- Custom modules can be written


Variable:
---------
- variables names should be letters,numbers and underscores
- varibale should always start with a letter
- can be scoped by group,hosts and even playbook

$ ansible -i hosts.ini labservers -m setup

Play and Playbook:
-----------------------
- A goal od play is to map a group of hosts to some well defined roles
- A play may use one or more modules to achieve a desired end state on a group of hosts
- A playbook is series of plays
- Deploy the application,config,making some changes application playbooks

Ansible Conifiguaration file:
------------------
#location of configuaration file

- ANSIBEL_CONFIG(environment variable)
- ansible.cfg(in the current directory)
- .ansible.cfg(in the home directory)
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

$ vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

#user creation for control node and slave nodes
--------------------------
$ sudo adduser ansible
$ sudo passwd ansible
$ sudo usermod -a -G cloud_user ansible
#Copy the public key of control host to both node1 and node2.
$ scp the public key of control host to slave nodes
$ ssh-copy-id node1 (accept the host key if prompted, authenticate as ansible user)

# In slave nodes 
$ sudo vi /etc/sudoers
#insert the below line
ansible    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

$ echo "maniissuriya5c.mylabserver.com" >> /home/ansible/inventory

ansible    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

Ad-Hoc
-----------
- Check log content
- Daemon control
- Process management
- Check installed software
- Check system properties
- Gather system performance(cpu,disk space,memory uses)
- Work with unfamiliar modules on test system


Inventory Management:
-------------
Locations:
- Deafult :/etc/ansible/hosts
- specifed by: ansible -i <inventory-file location>
- can be set in ansible.cfg
Inventory file may contain hosts,pattern,groups and varibales.
file supports in INI or YAML formats
Static(INI and yml) vs Dynamic(bash,python script)

# To call variables in Ad-hoc
$ ansible <inventory group-name> -i <inventory file> -b -a "ll {{vatiable-name}}"
